        "Fourteen years ago, the walls of Daraa bore a graffiti slogan that would ignite the Middle East. What followed was not merely a conflict, but the systematic dismantling of a modern state. The Syrian Civil War evolved from a localized uprising into a geopolitical black hole, rewriting the demographic map of the region, drawing in global superpowers, and creating a humanitarian emergency that continues to define the 21st century.",
        "This project serves as a digital archive of that unraveling. We focus on the critical decade of escalation—the formative years where the trajectory of the war was irrevocably set. By visualizing the unseen patterns of the conflict, we expose how peaceful demonstrations metastasized into a multi-front proxy war, turning ancient cities into battlegrounds and civilians into statistics.",
        "We look past the political rhetoric to the raw data. Aggregating millions of records from the UN, conflict monitors, and economic institutes, this report offers an evidence-based autopsy of the crisis. It charts the human cost of every airstrike, the economic shock of every sanction, and the silent tragedy of a population uprooted, offering a clear, undeniable record of what was lost."
