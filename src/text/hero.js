        "More than a decade after the first demonstrations in 2011, the Syrian conflict remains one of the defining crises of the modern Middle East. What began as peaceful protests quickly unfolded into a multi-front civil war that reshaped the region, drew in global powers, and created an unprecedented humanitarian emergency. The consequences of those early years still reverberate across borders, refugee communities, and international politics.",
        "This project examines that critical period — the formative years in which the conflict’s trajectory was set and its humanitarian toll became impossible to ignore. By focusing on these initial phases, we can trace how local unrest escalated into nationwide violence, how civilian areas became battlegrounds, and how economic and social infrastructures unraveled under the weight of prolonged conflict.",
        "Using data from humanitarian agencies, research institutions, and conflict-monitoring organizations, these visualizations offer a clearer view of the war’s human cost: the casualties recorded, the mass displacement that reshaped demographics, the shifting front lines that fragmented the country, and the economic collapse that followed. Rather than relying on political narratives or fragmented reporting, this project presents a consolidated, evidence-driven account of what happened — and why those early years remain essential to understanding Syria today.",
